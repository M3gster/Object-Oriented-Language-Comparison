## Why was the laguage created?
#### Java
Java was originally created with the intent to be used in embedded software for various types of electronics (The History and Evolution of Java). However, it ended up being used more for web based applications and that is where it's rise in popularity came from. It also was designed with a syntax similiar to C/C++ so programmers would be able to easily transition to the newer language(The History and Evolution of Java).

#### Swift
Swift was created by Apple to be used for many of their products. Swift is used to create iOS, macOS, and tvOS applications. 

## What problems was the language trying to address?
#### Java
C/C++ were designed to compile for a specific target. Java aimed to fix that. Java wanted to fix the issue, and be able to run on multiple CPU's in different environments (The History and Evolution of Java).
#### Swift
Swift was intending to fix the issues of safety and simplicity. Apple wanted code to behave in a safer manner.

## Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
#### Java
Java was intended to replace C/C++

#### Swift
"Swift is intended as a replacement for C-based languages," (About Swift).
