#### Java
A class can extend another (but only one other). A class can be extended by multiple subclasses. A class that extends another inherits it's members. The extended class is the superclass, and the one doing the extending is the subclass. The keyword extends is needed to inherit from another class.

#### Swift
A class in Swift can inherit methods, properties, and other characteristics from other classes. The one doing the inheriting is a subclass, and the one being inherited from is the suerclass (just like in java). Extending a class in Swift doesn't require an extends keyword, but the superclass instead follows a colon after the subclass.

Example:
```
class subClass: Superclass {
 //code
 }
 ```
