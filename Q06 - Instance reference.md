## this? self?
#### Java
Within an instance method or a constructor, **this** is a reference to the *current* object â€” the object whose method or constructor is being called. You can refer to any member of the current object from within an instance method or a constructor by using **this**.
#### Swift
Every instance of a type has an implicit property called **self**, which is exactly equivalent to the instance itself. You use the **self** property to refer to the current instance within its own instance methods.
