## What does the language support?
#### Java
Interfaces
#### Swift
Protocols

## What abilities does it have?
#### Java
- Interfaces as APIs
#### Swift
- Specify properties that must be implemented
- Deal with value/reference via the **mutating** keyword.
- Combine protocols at any time

## How is it used?
#### Java
Interfaces are used to write proprietary code which future classes can later implement without affecting the original interface code.
#### Swift
A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be adopted by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements.
