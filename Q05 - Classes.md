## Defining
#### Java
Defining a class is done through a class declaration. Class declarations can include: modifiers, class name, name of the superclass preceded by the word extends, a listed of implemented interfaces, and the class body.
Example:
```
class Cat {
  int age;
  string name;
  string color;
 }
 ```

## Creating new instances
#### Java
The new operator is needed to create an instance of the class. It sets aside memory for the new object and returns a reference to that memory. The new operator works by calling the object's constructor.
Example:
```
int height = new Rectangle().height;
```
