## How is reflection used?
#### Java
It allows an executing Java program to examine or "introspect" upon itself, and manipulate internal properties of the program. For example, it's possible for a Java class to obtain the names of all its members and display them.
#### Swift
Using a mirror, one can inspect the names and types of properties in an instance of a struct or an instance of a class.
